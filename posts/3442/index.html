A week later, the orginal plan was not carried out as I thought. Plan never catch up with reality, right? A few changes happened this week.  </p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one is the experiment with Tongtong, which took me four days. I had planned to write the research proposal in a week or so, don’t know why, I did not start yet. Mayebe it is the experiment that disturbed my plan, making me not know what to do.<br>The second thing is the seminar hold in my scoool. Qin xin and He wei attended this seminar, making this a compulsory one for OBHRM students. The speech made by Qin xin was wonderful. Smile never disappeared on our face in the whole process. The other two speech were, however, comparatively common for us. Many students left in the middle. Apart from the speech, I met a master student of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. We had a pleasant chat. It is always happy to meet someone.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is the seminar happened every Tuesday. So, in together, I speet nearly a week on things unrelated to my application. Luckily, the October has 31 days. I can still have time to deal with my affairs. On Tuesday, I talked with Prof Liu, who agreed to be a referee for me, and I applied my first credit card of ICBC.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, I did not go the the library. For me, the library is like my dorm. Everything is so familar for me, kind of boring. In constrast, the dorm seemed to be a perfect place for me to write documents. The big screen, the keyboard, I have the best facilities in the dorm. And most importantly, studing in the dorm is fresh for me, a totally new experience. Two days for SOP, one day for LME coding work, one day for recommadation letter, after finishing these work, I was still in October. Can you imagine that feeling? it is like you have run over the time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the frist day of November, there are a few things I need to do-Research proposal, Personal statement,soft copy and hard copy for online application. Hope I can get a good result in the end.</p>
