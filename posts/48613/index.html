<p>**<br>NewYork is 3 hours ahead of California**</p>
<p>but it does not make California slow.<br>Someone graduated at the age of 22,<br>but waited 5 years before securing a good job!<br>Someone became a CEO at 25,and died at 50.<br>While another became a CEO at 50,<br>and lived to 90 years.<br>Someone is still single,<br>while someone else got married.<br>Obama retires at 55,<br>but Trump starts at 70.<br>Absolutely everyone in this world works based on their TimeZone.<br>People around you might seem to go ahead of you,<br>some might seem to be behind you.<br>But everyone is running their own RACE,in their own TIME.<br>Don’t envy them or mock them.<br>They are in their TIME ZONE,<br>and you are in yours!<br>Life is aboutwaitingfor the right moment to act.<br>So, RELAX.<br>You’re not LATE.<br>You’re not EARLY.<br>You are very much ON TIME,<br>and in your TIMEZONE Destiny set up for you.</p>
