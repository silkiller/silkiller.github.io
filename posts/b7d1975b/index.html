<h1 id="Arne-Slot-Pre-Match-Press-Conference"><a href="#Arne-Slot-Pre-Match-Press-Conference" class="headerlink" title="Arne Slot Pre-Match Press Conference"></a>Arne Slot Pre-Match Press Conference</h1><p><em>Liverpool Manager - Premier League Trophy Presentation Match</em></p>
<h2 id="On-Mo-Salah’s-Ballon-d’Or-Chances"><a href="#On-Mo-Salah’s-Ballon-d’Or-Chances" class="headerlink" title="On Mo Salah’s Ballon d’Or Chances"></a>On Mo Salah’s Ballon d’Or Chances</h2><p><strong>Question:</strong> Mo Salah said this week that he feels it’s his best chance of ever winning the Ballon d’Or this year. What hopes do you have for him in that respect?</p>
<p><strong>Slot:</strong> A lot, because he’s completely right that he’s had very good seasons at Liverpool, but this one probably stands out in terms of numbers. If you add to that that we also won the league, that would probably give him a fair chance. But fortunately for all football fans around the world, he’s not the only player that has had a great season, so I think we were able to watch many great football players this season again. </p>
<p>But if there’s ever a chance for him, it would be this season. If not, then he’s going to try and push even harder next season - that’s what I already know with him. That would be some task for this season in terms of individual performance, that would be hardly impossible. Although never say that something is impossible for Mo because he’s proven that he can always raise his game even further. That’s the elite mentality that a star player should have - never be satisfied with where you are.</p>
<h2 id="On-Trophy-Celebration-and-Trent-Alexander-Arnold"><a href="#On-Trophy-Celebration-and-Trent-Alexander-Arnold" class="headerlink" title="On Trophy Celebration and Trent Alexander-Arnold"></a>On Trophy Celebration and Trent Alexander-Arnold</h2><p><strong>Question:</strong> Obviously Sunday we’re looking at celebration. What concerns do you have that the celebration could be overshadowed by any adverse reaction to Trent? Are you likely to give him five minutes or longer to say goodbye?</p>
<p><strong>Slot:</strong> I haven’t decided on that one yet. But I think this should be a day that everybody is going to enjoy. It’s been 35 years - everybody is waiting for this moment, or everybody but the Liverpool fans are waiting for this moment. </p>
<p>I think we’ve set the example against Tottenham. I don’t think I’ve ever been part of or seen celebration done in a nicer way than that day. One of the two things that make me emotional was how we arrived at the stadium when the fans were singing for us. The second one is that I’ve met multiple people in the last few weeks telling me they’ve been going to Anfield all their life, but they’ve never felt a day more special than that Tottenham home game.</p>
<p>I am hoping that we can add a moment like this to it. I think everybody that’s in the stadium deserves to be there - the fans, the staff, but also the players. And one of my players is Trent. So he definitely deserves to be there as well because he’s been part of an incredible successful season and incredible successful years at this club. I can only hope that we do it one more time like we did against Tottenham, and I have a lot of trust in our fans to do the same again.</p>
<h2 id="On-Lifting-the-Premier-League-Trophy"><a href="#On-Lifting-the-Premier-League-Trophy" class="headerlink" title="On Lifting the Premier League Trophy"></a>On Lifting the Premier League Trophy</h2><p><strong>Question:</strong> What will your overriding emotion be when you and your players finally lift that Premier League trophy?</p>
<p><strong>Slot:</strong> Proud - that sums it up the most. After working here for a year, now I know even better how hard it is. That’s why I said it’s the hardest trophy to win because cup trophies you can win by a lucky draw or being lucky in two or three games, maybe win a penalty shootout, and then all of a sudden you arrive in the final. </p>
<p>But it’s always harder to win the league because it’s 38 games in a period of time where the league has never been as strong as it is. I don’t think there’s ever been so much competition. There’s never been a season where the number 16 and 17 of the Premier League play in a final against each other in the Europa League. That’s what makes it so hard. So that would definitely be a proud moment for me and for the players and also for our fans.</p>
<h2 id="On-Future-Potential-and-Serial-Winning-Mentality"><a href="#On-Future-Potential-and-Serial-Winning-Mentality" class="headerlink" title="On Future Potential and Serial Winning Mentality"></a>On Future Potential and Serial Winning Mentality</h2><p><strong>Question:</strong> Alan Hansen is presenting the trophy to you on Saturday. He was part of a team that won eight league titles in a decade. What is the potential of your team? Do you think you’ve got the potential to achieve something similar?</p>
<p><strong>Slot:</strong> I think we have a lot to compete next season again. But what I don’t know yet, and that’s going to be the interesting one, is if we have this elite mentality - this serial winner mentality of showing up season after season after season. I think I get the answer already on the 8th of July when we come back together, to see in what shape the players are.</p>
<p>Many teams have won the Premier League once, but not many have won them multiple seasons in a row, and that’s for a reason. First of all, because it’s so difficult. Second of all, not every player has this elite mentality. When I talk about Mo, it’s not a coincidence that he’s been at a certain level for seven years already. Last season, he was the one that was the most fit when we arrived back after the break. That is a mentality you need to have to have a chance of becoming a serial winner.</p>
<p>This is something we have to prove - the players have to prove and me as well during the offseason. The first day for me to judge if we have a chance to become serial winners is the 8th of July when I see them back.</p>
<h2 id="On-Joe-Gomez"><a href="#On-Joe-Gomez" class="headerlink" title="On Joe Gomez"></a>On Joe Gomez</h2><p><strong>Question:</strong> It was nice to see Joe Gomez back in the squad. His next appearance will be his 150th for Liverpool. Is he ready to make that this weekend?</p>
<p><strong>Slot:</strong> Last weekend he was there with the team but he was not able to play yet - he didn’t tick all the boxes yet. But there was a spot open, so it was for me a moment where I could show my gratitude towards him for what he’s done on the pitch for us but also off the pitch.</p>
<p>This is also something I want to address with Trent - for a fan these players are all professionals, but for me as a manager they’re not only the player but they’re also the human being. Joe Gomez is indeed one of the nicest persons you can meet, but he’s also inspiring his teammates when he’s not playing. He has had more impact on our success than the outside world might probably know. I’m hoping that he can make some minutes on Sunday if he ticks all the boxes this week.</p>
<h2 id="On-Coaching-Philosophy-and-Player-Development"><a href="#On-Coaching-Philosophy-and-Player-Development" class="headerlink" title="On Coaching Philosophy and Player Development"></a>On Coaching Philosophy and Player Development</h2><p><strong>Question:</strong> Quite a few individual players have made the point that you’ve changed their game in some way. What is it that you have in your coaching toolbox that enables elite players to get even better?</p>
<p><strong>Slot:</strong> I can only tell you what I did, and I’m quite sure Jurgen did the same things. But if you are eight or nine years together, working for a long time together with the players, that’s going to happen with me as well. Maybe at a certain moment players get a little bit more used to the things you tell them.</p>
<p>We always try to inspire them to get the best out of them every three days - the best in work rate and quality - and we always try to let the team play better together, and as a result of that the individual looks much better. Every manager has his own way of doing these things. There are many similarities between Jurgen and me, but it would be completely surprising if every team meeting and the way we inspire were exactly the same. It’s maybe just a new face in front of them - not better, not worse, just new that lifted them maybe a little bit.</p>
<h2 id="On-Recent-Form-and-Sunday’s-Match"><a href="#On-Recent-Form-and-Sunday’s-Match" class="headerlink" title="On Recent Form and Sunday’s Match"></a>On Recent Form and Sunday’s Match</h2><p><strong>Question:</strong> In the three games since the title was yours, you haven’t been able to come up with the win. What’s going to enable you to make that happen on Sunday?</p>
<p><strong>Slot:</strong> We need to do maybe a few things better, but in my opinion, we’ve done a lot of things very good in all these three games. I was really happy with the fact that we already won the league because Chelsea away is for everyone a difficult game, Arsenal at home is for everyone a difficult game, and Brighton away is for everyone a difficult game as well.</p>
<p>I’ve seen many good things throughout these three games but we conceded three against Chelsea, two against Arsenal, three against Brighton. That’s not our standards throughout the whole season. Normally we don’t concede eight goals in three games. That tells you that maybe in terms of work rate, the runs we make, the distance we run - no one can tell us that we switched off. But blocking a cross, blocking a shot, throwing yourself in front of a ball - that is maybe one or two percent less. And then immediately this league hurts you.</p>
<p>I think all three games we were close to winning. We didn’t because we faced three very good teams. We’re hoping we can win on Sunday, but we’re going to face a strong team again because this team won against City.</p>
<h2 id="On-Conversations-with-Trent-Alexander-Arnold"><a href="#On-Conversations-with-Trent-Alexander-Arnold" class="headerlink" title="On Conversations with Trent Alexander-Arnold"></a>On Conversations with Trent Alexander-Arnold</h2><p><strong>Question:</strong> Have you spoken about the reaction he got last time at Anfield and his expectations for this weekend?</p>
<p><strong>Slot:</strong> I talk to most players not on a daily basis but a lot, and especially if there are circumstances why I should talk to them. It’s clear that in Trent’s situation there are circumstances for me to talk more with him than with Virgil, for example. I think that is the biggest difference between me and all the ones that have an opinion - that I speak to the human being Trent Alexander-Arnold every day, and I think combined with winning something together creates a different bond than maybe the fans have with him.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What conversation did he come to have with you in preseason?</p>
<p><strong>Slot:</strong> Maybe he has said it himself and he’s going to leave either way, so why not tell it. Maybe it’s already a first gift I can give Xabi Alonso, but I wasn’t completely happy with every single minute how he was on the training ground. In my opinion, he could in certain moments do a bit more, to say it mildly.</p>
<p>Combined with that, I said to him: “You’re a much better defender than everybody tells you. Unfortunately, you don’t show it all the time. That’s why people sometimes say this is a part of your game you need to improve. But if you are just at it and you’re focused and concentrated, there are not many players that can go around you because you’re fast, you’re agile, you have a great mentality.”</p>
<p>It’s about showing that every single game because in this world we are judged not only on the 34 games we do well - we are mainly judged on the four games that we don’t do so well.</p>
<h2 id="On-Luis-Diaz-and-Barcelona-Interest"><a href="#On-Luis-Diaz-and-Barcelona-Interest" class="headerlink" title="On Luis Díaz and Barcelona Interest"></a>On Luis Díaz and Barcelona Interest</h2><p><strong>Question:</strong> Barcelona sporting director Deco said how much they like Luis Díaz. What do you think about that?</p>
<p><strong>Slot:</strong> Every club has its own way of doing things. You are used to the fact that I don’t talk about players from other clubs that we haven’t signed. I understand that he’s a big admirer of Luis Díaz because I’m a big admirer of him as well - he’s a great player having a great season. If he just meant it that way, then he probably would have added that he’s an admirer of Mo Salah and Gakpo as well. I admire Lamine Yamal and Raphinha a lot as well, by the way.</p>
<h2 id="On-Dominik-Szoboszlai’s-Deeper-Role"><a href="#On-Dominik-Szoboszlai’s-Deeper-Role" class="headerlink" title="On Dominik Szoboszlai’s Deeper Role"></a>On Dominik Szoboszlai’s Deeper Role</h2><p><strong>Question:</strong> We saw against Brighton Dom playing a little bit deeper as an operator. Had he had that conversation with you about giving him a chance in that position?</p>
<p><strong>Slot:</strong> As many players did, we as a team played a good game. Unfortunately, Brighton played a very good game as well. I think he had a great pass towards Mo which was the lead-up to the first goal. He played a good game - nothing new to see, just interesting to see the dynamic in midfield with Harvey, Dom, and Ryan behind him.</p>
<p>If he wants to play in that position, he is in big competition because I’m also an admirer of Mac Allister. It was interesting to see but not much more than that.</p>
