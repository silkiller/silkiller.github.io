<span id="more"></span>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;佩洛西的访台不是突然的，早在4月份便传出佩洛西要访台的消息，但是由于新冠阳性没有成行，是否是战略阳性不得而知。原本以为佩洛西的访台之行会告一段落，没想到很快英国的金融时报就传出消息，佩洛西将再次访台。但与上次不同，这次的访台明显在外交和政治层面掀起了滔天巨浪，外交部的连续抗议和“放狠话”，多少让佩洛西有所顾忌，在官方行程上，台湾并不是目的地之一。但很快，在访问新加坡之后，佩洛西的飞机绕过南海，经过菲律宾抵达台湾松山机场，这场外交政治危机也正式拉开帷幕。<br>就在佩洛西的飞机降落台湾之前，50万的Flightradar24用户，有30万在跟踪佩洛西的飞机SPAR19，我也是其中之一。我以为至少有伴飞驱离，甚至拦截强制飞机转向，但是没有。我承认那一刻我也失望过，即使立马宣布的绕台军演也无法让我心情平息。但经过两天的军演，导弹飞越台北、飞机军舰越过海峡中线、飞机目视距离看到海岸线和中央山脉、军舰看到和平发电厂等事件后，我承认当初的愤慨已经消解了不少。让我最终心平气和甚至理解佩洛西飞机降落那一晚的我方行动，还是后来的国际反应，除了G7的声明外，基本没有国家出来反对，我们的军演在军事上取得了实质性的成果：海峡中线不再束缚解放军；台湾的领空领海也不再具有约束力等等。今天的纽约时报文章，虽然标题依然是阴阳怪气的风格，但内容和评论还是说明了很多问题，在此也搬运一些过来：  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>nydoc</strong><br>Xi and multiple sources mentioned that those who play with fire will get burned.  This reaction is totally expected.  If China did not do these exercises, they would lose face. The US must show restraint during this manufactured crisis.  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pigsy</strong><br>Justified or not, China’s actual response to Pelosi’s Taiwan visit remains entirely within the realm of “likely” reactions. The question then given that what we see was always a likely consequence, is what Pelosi (and probably the Biden administration) is trying to achieve. What cascade were they hoping to set into motion?  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mitchel</strong><br>What was the purpose of Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in the first place? I have not seen any stated point anywhere. All it’s accomplished is stirring up the wasp nest. And it was contrary to Biden’s wishes.  Seems really stupid to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>BK</strong><br>The window of opportunity is closing for Taiwan.  In the not so distant future China’s economic and military prowess will far surpass that of the United States.  It’s simply a matter of population and time.  They have reformed Hong Kong to their liking and have every intention to settle once and for all the Chinese Civil War.  It will be a sea change.  The table will have turned and the West will likely suffer its own century of humiliation.  This is why the outcome of the Russo-Ukrainian War is so important.  A stronger, united Europe is a necessity for the Enlightenment to survive the 21st century.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Usok</strong><br>The bottom line is that we cannot say one thing and do another.   We follow “One China” principle and then sent high-ranking government official to Taiwan using our governmental airplane with accompanying fighter jets to protect her safety while aircraft carrier Roosevelt sails in the not-too-distant location. Ms. Pelosi’s trip was an official visit openly defiant of the “One China” principle.<br>China’s reaction was fast and furious, unexpectedly setting up military action zones surrounded Taiwan island within 20 Km distance. It is a public statement that Taiwan is part of China and Chinese sovereignty cannot be challenged.  China probably has prepared for this. And we didn’t expect this to happen so fast.  </p>

<p><strong>AnneW</strong><br>FIFTY YEARS AGO<br>FEBRUARY 27, 1972<br>FROM THE JOINT COMMUNIQUE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA<br>“The two sides reviewed the long-standing serious disputes between China and the United States.The US side declared:<br>“The United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The United States Government does not challenge that position. It reaffirms its interest in a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese themselves. With this prospect in mind, it affirms the ultimate objective of the withdrawal of all US forces and military installations from Taiwan. In the meantime, it will progressively reduce its forces and military installations on Taiwan as the tension in the area diminishes.”<br>“Who is the reliable and trustworthy party?.”<br>Let’s look at recent history:<br>Trump’s stated intention to pull America out of NATO, America’s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, America’s withdrawal from nuclear negotiations with Iran, ……<br>We have made a hash of this and Pelosi’s provocations are inexcusable.</p>
