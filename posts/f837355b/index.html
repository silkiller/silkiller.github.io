<p> Dear Mr Klopp, you’re wasted in football… Why can’t politicians be more like Jürgen?</p>
<p>Jürgen, thought about going into politics?</p>
<p>Dear Mr Klopp,</p>
<p>I’m doing a German course and for my homework this week I have to write someone a letter. As I am also editor-at-large at The New European newspaper, I had the idea of writing this letter to you, and publishing it in German and also in English.</p>
<p>I’m a big Burnley fanatic and a friend of our recently departed manager Sean Dyche, and you’ve sometimes criticised my club and our style of play. As Sean is no longer with us, however, I can say that you are now not only the longest-serving manager in the Premier League, but also the one I admire the most. I would like to explain why in my letter.</p>
<p>First, you have built a wonderful team. As Graeme Souness said after your 4-0 win over Manchester United, this team plays the best football Liverpool fans have ever seen. And Graeme Souness is qualified to talk about that.</p>
<p>I love your passion. For football. For your players. For the fans. For the city and its history. You understand why the Hillsborough 97 are, and always will be, so important. You understand why The Sun will never be welcome in Liverpool. You understand the importance of football in the life of the city, not just Liverpool FC, but Everton, Tranmere, and hundreds of amateur clubs.</p>
<p>I love it when you step on to the field with a giant smile and hug the players at the end of a match. I love that fist punch on your chest that you do in front of the Kop. I admire how you develop and improve players. I did an interview with Trent Alexander-Arnold for GQ magazine two years ago and he spoke of you and your management with genuine love.</p>
<p>He said: “He is unbelievable. Just everything about him in every way. As a person, as a manager. Just unbelievable. He’s a loving person, you can see that he’s someone who cares about the people around him. He cares about his family, he cares about his players, he cares about his staff. He treats everyone as equals. Treats the captain the same as you would a young player. People probably have a conception of him as being maybe very emotional. Heart on the sleeve. Which he is to an extent, but he knows how to control it in ways that are beneficial to everyone around him.</p>
<p>“He keeps our mentality 100%. He makes sure that the message is instilled in us every single day to make sure that we’re our best.”</p>
<p>I wish I had interviewed you for my 2015 book Winners and How They Succeed, in which I wrote about my “Holy Trinity”, Strategy, Leadership and Teamwork. It seems to me that you are master of all three, especially when it comes to the link between leadership and teamship.</p>
<p>I once saw you angrily criticise Virgil van Dijk for two rare mistakes as he played. Maybe the best defender in the world. But someone who has so much respect for you that he knew he had to do better, and he did afterwards. What a difference to our prime minister who constantly lies, flatters, deceives to keep his team by his side.</p>
<p>Yes, let’s come to politics. I also see that you are so much more than just a football man. You know you are privileged to have become rich in a job you love so much.</p>
<p>You know that if you have money and power or influence, you also have a responsibility to help others who are less fortunate in life. You know that the richest have to pay their taxes and not avoid them as so many do. I know how much you do for the community, as you did in Mainz and Dortmund.</p>
<p>When Covid-19 entered our lives, you immediately understood the seriousness of the situation. You said this is more important than football – a message not to be underestimated in this football-crazy city that is Liverpool.</p>
<p>And a city that hates authority, and where many people were willing to turn down the vaccine, heard from you that getting it was important. Leadership!</p>
<p>Thank you for speaking out against Brexit because you understand it is not good either for Britain or for Europe. You are aware that populism is a real danger.</p>
<p>You asked – good question – why our country gives political power to liars like Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage? You have values, Mr Klopp, which these opportunists do not have and will never understand.</p>
<p>We see these values in the football you play and the life you lead. You believe that one should always try to tell the truth. You believe that strong people have a responsibility to help the weak.</p>
<p>Even if you have never read the Labour party constitution, I know you understand – and live – its key point, that we can achieve more together than we do alone.</p>
<p>I do a podcast every week with former Conservative minister Rory Stewart. Last week we had a question from a listener. “Who among Premier League managers would be the best political leader?”</p>
<p>The answer was undoubtedly Labour supporter and former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson for many years. Today, Mr Klopp, without a doubt, it is you.</p>
<p>I wish our real so-called leaders of the country would study your type of leadership. How wonderful it would be if they had your passion for their work. Your attention to detail. Your ability to innovate and adapt. If they had your ability as a communicator. Above all, if they had your ability to bring so much joy and pride to a community.</p>
<p>So thank you. Thank you for everything you give to our country. Thank you for the nice football. Thank you for your love of northern England. Thank you for reminding us that we have good leaders in this country even if, sadly, they are not in the government.</p>
<p>Good luck in your pursuit of the Quadruple. And I hope that, once the trophy cupboard is overflowing, you think about going into politics. Our country needs you!</p>
